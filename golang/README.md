# Go Sample Code

This directory contains sample code to get you started querying the COVID-19 open data collections with Golang.

This code was developed Go 1.14 - there are no guarantees it will work with earlier versions of Go.

All of the code can be found in [example/main.go](example/main.go).

## Run using Docker

If you don't have go 1.14, you can test this program using Docker.

- The script `0-docker-build.sh` will build the docker image with the Go program compiled in it.
- The script `1-docker-run.sh` will run the Go program within a docker container and destroy said container when it's over.
- If you want to remove the docker image from your computer, you can run `2-docker-clean.sh`.

```shell script
./0-docker-build.sh
./1-docker-run.sh
./2-docker-clean.sh
```

## Run using Go

If you have Go 1.14 installed you can build the sample code binary by running `make` in this directory.

The Makefile will build an executable in the current directory, called `golang_example`.

If you run `golang_example` the results should look something like this:

```text
open-data-covid-19/golang $ ./golang_example
